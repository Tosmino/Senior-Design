AUTOMATIC RESPONSE PERSONAL TRANSLOCATOR BEACON

# FUNCTIONALITY
This device measures a variety of different vitals alongside fall detection.
The device is split up into two parts, a main pack and a wrist mounted unit

The wristband mounted unit measures vitals and detects sudden changes in acceleration.
This information is then used to decide if an emergency is detected. This detection
is then sent via bluetooth to the main pack. 

The main pack receives the signal
then prompts the user for input. If no input is detected or a manual switch is flipped,
the pack transmits a distress signal containing coordinates to the proper authorities 
via satellite transmission.

# WHAT IT IS USED FOR
This device would be utilized by the standard outdoorsmen especially if hiking alone.
The point of the device would be to send out a distress signal when a person may otherwise
not be able to send one out. Thus hopefully saving more people from preventable tragedies.

# DISCLAIMER
This project is a work in progress and not to be considered a finished product.
